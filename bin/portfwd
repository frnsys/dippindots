# Imagine traffic is going from left to right:
# --->$1--->$2
# So if you want a remote host to forward to your local machine, do:
# portfwd me@remote:80 8000
# If you want a local host to forward to a remote host, do:
# portfwd 8000 me@remote:8000

# NOTE: you are forwarding from a remote host to your local machine,
# you must edit the remote host's /etc/ssh/sshd_config (or equivalent)
# to have the following:
#     Match User ftseng
#         GatewayPorts yes
# To check that the remote port forwarding properly works, you can run the following on the remote server:
#     netstat -an | grep <the remote port>
# You should see a line that looks like (for example, if the remote port is 8080):
#     tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:8080 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN
# Also, don't forget to open that port up in the firewall. For example, if using `ufw` and with remote port 8080:
#     sudo ufw allow 8080

LOCALRE='^[0-9]+$' # just check if looks like a port
REMOTERE='^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+:[0-9]+$'
